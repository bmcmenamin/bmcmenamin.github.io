As easy as Keras makes it to develop new models, there's still a lot of repeated work across tasks. You'll need to define a class to hold your model, build in methods for making predictions, group data samples into training batches, and figure out how to handle saving/loading. I didn't want to reinvent all that every time I used a tensorflow in a side project, so I've put together this repo to hold all of that model structure. Hopefully I'll do something cool with this to make the time investment worthwhile down the road...

I've started out including standard model types with some MNIST toy examples and unit tests. Eventually, I hope to flesh this out with some additional features such as:
* DataManager for handling sequential data (timeseries, text series)
* Siamese/Triplet training
* Streaming interface for large training corpuses (corpi?)

Anyway, here's [modelwrangler](http://github.com/bmcmenamin/modelwrangler). Just add a new model class to the [corral](https://github.com/bmcmenamin/modelwrangler/tree/master/modelwrangler/corral), and you're on your way.

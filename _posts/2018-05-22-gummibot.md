Yesterday I learned that one of [John Williams' sons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Williams_(musician)) sang the [Gummi Bears theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRTSZZgCUik). He was also in the band Toto for a few years, but wasn't there when they released Africa (*i.e.*, the Toto song people know).

This seemed like something important that I needed to tell people about. So, true to the name of this blog, I decided to make a Twitter bot to help me out.

[Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) provides a nice wrapper around the Twitter API so it only took a few minutes to get going. It helped that the bot's logic was simple:
* Find recent tweets that include the phrase `gummi bears theme song` but not `williams` or `toto`
* Check if I've already sent those users a tweet, because I don't want to spam you and get flagged. Although, if you're the person that is tweeting about the gummi bears theme song frequently, you might *really* like this project...
* Reply to the tweets

Here's a shot in action:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i thought you might like to know that the Gummi Bears Theme Song was sung by John Williams&#39; son.</p>&mdash; john williams&#39; son sang the gummi bears theme (@johnwilliamsso1) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsso1/status/998763992465199104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2018</a></blockquote>

This simple bot framework [here](https://github.com/bmcmenamin/sundries/tree/master/gummibot) can be adapted to do any search query and auto-reply with a payload. I hope the internet uses this technology responsibly...

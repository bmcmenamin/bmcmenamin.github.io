As I [mentioned earlier]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-24-moby-dick-2 %}), I want to build a machine to write a sequel to Moby Dick.


I've made a couple changes to the training algorithm. Before, the sliding window would move one character at a time and end up creating a training batch that would focus heavily on a narrow piece of text. I added the ability to make the window stride by more than one character, and this simple change has lead to much better results.

As you can see below, there's still nonsense words and too many question marks, but now there are also a lot more *real* words!

I suspect the questionmark issue is due to thh character embedding layer placing all the punctuation too close to one another... a problem for another day.

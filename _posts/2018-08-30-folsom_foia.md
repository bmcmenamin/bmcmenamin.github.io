I've needed a reason to start working with JavaScript and D3. Once I filed a bunch of FOIA requests about Johnny Cash's _At Folsom Prison_, I finally had something to work on. See the results <a href='/ext/folsom_foia'>here</a>.

I've used the package [Scrollama](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama) to build a generic template for a scroll-able timeline annotated with images and captions in [this repo](https://github.com/bmcmenamin/folsom_foia).

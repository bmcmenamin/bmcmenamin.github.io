A while ago, Insight Data Science asked it I would write a blog post talk about the project I did while I was a fellow there. I wrote a [blog post](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/legislator-prognosticator-45aa6fd12013) that had a bunch of cool interactive Bokeh plots, but they've since change blogging platforms and they're stick with static images now. I've also stopped hosting the app on my own domain, so I thought I'd put the supplemental figures here.

Note: these probably look terrible on mobile.

You may have seen this Douglas Adams quote about old people and technology:

> I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
> Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
> Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
> Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”


I've found these age boundaries to be pretty reasonable when thinking about individuals, but I was curious what these
age cutoffs would imply when scaled up to the entire population. What percentage of Americans would think of present day as 'exciting' or 'against the natural order of things'? How have these proportion changed over time? Can I blame everything on baby boomers?


### So many file formats...

I assumed it would be easy to download some records from the census that'd let me graph the distribution of ages over the last several years in the US. After all, they had made this nice visualization of age distributions changing over time [here](https://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/055/). I was very wrong.

The census *does* have the data I want, but the format and layout change over time:

* Historical data for every year from [1900 to 1980](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/pre-1980-national.html) is in Excel sheets. Depending on the year, the maximum age is 75 or 85.
* Data for [1980-1990](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/1980s-national.html) is in a whole bunch of fixed-width formatted tables.
* Data for [1990-2000](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-1990-2000-national.html) in a single CSV.
* Data for [2000-2010 data](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-2000-2010-national.html) in a single Excel sheet, except onw they've swithced to reporting age in 5-year buckets rather than single year buckets
* Projections of future population every five years until 2060 that you can only find [off-site](https://data.world/garyhoov/us-population-2060-by-age)

I wrote the script [here](https://github.com/bmcmenamin/sundries/blob/master/age_distro/import_and_align_datasets.py) to load all these files and force them into a single table saved in CSV format [here](https://github.com/bmcmenamin/sundries/blob/master/age_distro/historical_age_data_combined.csv). However, given that the sampling intervals change after the year 2000, I applied polynomial interpolation to the age distribution within each year to standardize things. I also used polynomial interpolation to standardize the sampling over time to make sure the future projections were every year through 2060. I know that these interpolation methods aren't super-precise, but they're good enough for this non-scientific side project. The interpolated CSV lives [here](https://github.com/bmcmenamin/sundries/blob/master/age_distro/historical_age_data_combined_interpedAges.csv).


### Visualizing US population ages

Once all these files are put together, you can plot the age distribution over time with a heatmap plot like this:

<img src="/figs/age_distro/age_distro_heatmap.png" width="600">

The _x_-axis is time and the _y_-axis is age. The more purple-y the color, the more prominently that particular age group is  in that year. The most striking feature of this plot is low birthrate during the late 1930's followed by the baby-boom of the mid 1940s, resulting in adjacent light and dark bands streaking upward at a 45-degree slant.


### Scary times

Now I can measure the proportion of the population that would describe their present day as 'Normal' (age 0-15), 'Exciting' (age 15-35), or 'Scary' (35+) using the three age buckets laid by Douglas Adams. [**Note:** I'm assuming that the truthiness of this quote is stable over time. In actuality, that's probably not true given how a) the timelines for reaching various adulthood milestones have changed since 1900 and b) we've acclimated to a different rate of technological progress over time]

This year along the _x_-axis and stacked area plots on the _y_-axis that indicate what percentage of the US population would have describe the year they were currently living in as 'normal' (yellow), 'exciting' (orange), or 'scary' (red).

<img src="/figs/age_distro/plurality_vote_present_day.png" width="600">

At the beginning of the 20th century, the US population was divided into roughly equal groups (35% normal, 37% exciting, 28% scary). As our population has aged, the proportion has skewed more toward scary, with present day (2017) at  51% scary and 29% exiting. It doesn't look like this trend isn't going to slow down either -- by 2060 we'll be up to 57% sary and 26% exciting.

### When *were* the good ol' days?

So if our increasingly aged population has pushed the majority opinion to 'things these days are scary and against the natural order of things'... how far back would you have to look to find a time that the present-day population would consider 'exciting'?

In the previous section we would have looked at the population in a particular year and used their age to figure out if they thought *that* year was normal/exciting/scary. We can also infer their opinions about previous years and how old they would've been then. We can measure how far back we have to go from present day until the plurality opinion is 'exciting'. The older the current population is, the further back you'll need to go to find the "good ol' days".

This plot shows how big that 'nostalgia lag' is in each year. In the earliest parts of the 20th century, the plurality of citizens were in the 'exciting' age bucket so the time lag was 0. However, as the population grows older, they became nostalgic for periods that were further and further away from the present day. In present day (2017) that time lag is at 18 years, meaning that the most recent year that the population would consider 'exciting' was 1999. Using the projected population statistics, we'll have to wait until 2041 to have a population that will be able to look back at 2017 and remember it as an 'exciting' time.

For a more complete picture of what every year thinks of every *other* year, we've got this colorful monstrosity.

The color indicates the plurality opinion of the year indicated on the _y_-axis according to the population in the year on the _x_-axis.

We can clearly the emergence of the opinion 'current day is scary' (red) serving as a wedge between the present day and the period of nostalgia for the previous 'exciting' times (orange).

### Conclusion

In conclusion... baby boomers aren't going away.

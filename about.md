My name is Brenton and I'm a data person in NYC.

The name of this blog comes from lyrics to the [1997 MTV Music video of the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et9b7LWfnxQ&feature=youtu.be&t=1m3s).

The original purpose of this blog was to force me to clean up my git repos and official 'end' various side projects that I start. Unfortunately, this blog has caused me to start a few projects that will never end.
